- Add advanced delay scheduling (e.g. more agressive at night)
- Interface for URL Store -- Need to make configurable
- Interface for Document Store??? Filesystem default, but could be 
  others like MongoDB?

- Consider changing .properties to .variables to avoid properties editor (support both types?)
  to escape some characters in Eclipse?
- Delete .raw copy even when status is "unmodified"

     or just [before|after]Import if we consider removing all the "document" 
     in methods. 
- Add junit tests
